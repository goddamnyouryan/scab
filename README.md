# Tweeker Embed Code

> Simple a/b and multivariate testing

The embed code for [Tweeker](https://tweeker.io) that you include on your page template.

It's an ES6 Javascript library that talks to the Tweeker API to pull in your variant and goal data and display it to your users.

It uses localStorage to save variant and goal data locally so that your users get a consistent experience, and also save on bandwidth.

## Usage

Visit [https://app.tweeker.io/embed](https://app.tweeker.io/embed) to get your embed code. It will look something like this:

```
<script>
  window.TweekerSettings = {
    businessId: YOUR_BUSINESS_ID
  }
</script>

<script>
  (function(){
    var i, e, d = document, s = "script";i = d.createElement("script");i.async = 1;
    i.src = "https://embed.tweeker.io/latest.js";
    e = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];e.parentNode.insertBefore(i, e);
  })();
</script>
```
It basically just adds the https://embed.tweeker.io/latest.js javascript to the end of your `</head>` tag.

The contents of https://embed.tweeker.io/latest.js are generated by this library.
